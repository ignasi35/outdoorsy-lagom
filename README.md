# outdoorsy-lagom

`outdoorsy-lagom` is a lagom 1.2.x pet project. It's a site for people who like outdoors activities, a meetup clone.

### Design ideas

Users may share `route`s for other users with other users.

Users may form `groups` and organize excursions over those `route`s .

Users may `like` each other's `route`s.

Users will get `karma` for every like on their `route` and for each participant on an excursion on their `route`.
